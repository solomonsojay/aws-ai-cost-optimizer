## üåü Overview
The AWS AI Cost Optimizer leverages generative AI through AWS Bedrock to analyze your cloud infrastructure costs and provide actionable optimization recommendations. This solution helps businesses reduce AWS spending by 25-40% through AI-powered insights.

## ‚öôÔ∏è How AWS Lambda Powers This Solution
AWS Lambda serves as the **core processing engine** of our application:

1. **AI Gateway**: Receives requests from the frontend and communicates with AWS Bedrock
2. **Prompt Engineering**: Generates optimized prompts for Claude AI based on cost data
3. **Response Processing**: Formats AI output into structured markdown recommendations
4. **Error Handling**: Manages timeouts and Bedrock API exceptions
5. **Security Layer**: Validates requests before processing

**Lambda Configuration**:
- Runtime: Python 3.10
- Memory: 512MB
- Timeout: 30 seconds
- Permissions: `AWSBedrockFullAccess`
- Trigger: Lambda Function URL (HTTPS endpoint)
